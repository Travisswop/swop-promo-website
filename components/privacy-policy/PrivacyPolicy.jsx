              Cases will be handled by attorneys licensed in the local
              jurisdiction. Before you decide, you may ask us to send you free
              written information about our qualifications and experience. FREE
              BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. No
              representation is made that the lawyers are certified specialists
              or experts in any field of law. And no representation is made that
              the legal services to be performed are greater than the quality of
              legal services performed by other lawyers. Anyone considering a
              lawyer should independently investigate the lawyer’s credentials
              and ability, and not rely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed
              expertise. No representation is made here about your specific
              rights. Every case is different and must be judged on its own
              merits. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.
              Contingent attorney fees are negotiable and not set by law. Costs
              and fees are charged only upon monetary recovery. Not available in
              all states. Cases may be handled in association with, or referred
              to, other law firms as co-counsel or referral counsel.`}
